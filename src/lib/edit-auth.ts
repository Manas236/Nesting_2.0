/* ============================================================
   Editor sign-in — the shared rules
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Two layers, and it matters that they are not confused with each
   other:

     the SECRET PATH (`EDIT_LOGIN_SLUG`) controls DISCOVERY. It is
     what keeps /studio/<slug> off every crawler, every wordlist and
     every bored visitor's address bar. It is not authorisation, and
     nothing in this file or anywhere else may treat "knows the URL"
     as "may write". The login page is the only thing that ever reads
     it, and all it unlocks is the sight of a passphrase box.

     the PASSPHRASE (`EDIT_PASSPHRASE`) is the actual protection. It
     is what turns into a signed cookie, and that cookie is what every
     write route checks.

   STATELESS ON PURPOSE. A session is a signed string the browser
   carries, not a row in a table and not a Map in this process. There
   is one node process behind nginx and it gets restarted for every
   content deploy (`systemctl restart nestingtree`, DEPLOYMENT.md §9);
   an in-memory session store would sign the person editing out in the
   middle of a sentence, every single deploy. Nothing here is written
   down, so nothing can be lost.

   The cost of that trade is the one to know about: a token cannot be
   revoked individually. Signing everybody out is done by changing
   EDIT_SECRET or EDIT_PASSPHRASE, which invalidates every token at
   once. For one shared passphrase held by one or two people, that is
   the right shape.
