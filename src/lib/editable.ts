/* ============================================================
   Inline editing — the rules, in one place
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Imported by BOTH sides of the feature:

     · the API routes in src/pages/api/content*        (server)
     · src/scripts/inline-edit.js                      (browser)

   That is the whole point of this file. What the browser will let you
   click into and what the server will let you save must never disagree,
   so both answers are computed from the rules here rather than from two
   copies that drift apart.

   WHAT IS CHECKED, as of the owner's decision on 13 Aug 2026:

     · the page is one of KNOWN_PATHS
     · the edit_key is shaped like a key we generated
     · the text is non-empty, and no longer than MAX_TEXT
     · the text is stripped of markup and control characters

   That is all. There is deliberately NO check on what the text SAYS.
   Until 13 Aug 2026 this file also carried a denylist that locked any
   string shaped like a figure off an official document — prices, RERA
   numbers, phone numbers, measurements. The owner asked for it gone, so
   it is gone: every run of copy on an editable page is now editable by
   anyone who loads the page, because this feature has no login.

   Keep this file free of server-only imports (no mysql2, no node:*): it
   is bundled into the client script.

   The character classes are built with new RegExp("...\\uXXXX...") on
   purpose. Several rules turn on characters you cannot see (nbsp,
   zero-width joiners) or cannot tell apart on screen (hyphen vs en dash
   vs minus); a literal one pasted into a regex is a silent bug.

   Where an edit came from
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Nobody logs in to edit this site, so the address and the user agent
   are the only record of who changed a line. That makes them audit
   data, and audit data has to be either true or absent — a wrong
   address is worse than none, so anything that does not parse is
   stored as NULL rather than as the raw string or a placeholder.

   The address arrives in X-Forwarded-For, which nginx sets. That header
   is a list: nginx appends the connecting address to whatever the client
   already sent, so a client can put anything it likes in front of it.
   The first entry is the closest thing to the real origin, and it is
   entirely attacker-controlled, which is why it is parsed rather than
   trusted. If it is not an address, we fall back to the socket address,
   which cannot be forged.

   These run server-side only, but they live here because this module is
   the one both halves share; nothing in them touches node:*, so the
   client bundle can still tree-shake them away.
