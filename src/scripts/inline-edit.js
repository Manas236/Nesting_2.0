   In-page text editing — the editor
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Part 2 of 2. The early-boot half lives inline in the head of
   BaseLayout.astro and hangs window.__ntEdit: the page path, the
   edit_key walk, text normalisation, and the localStorage cache. This
   file calls back into those rather than reimplementing them, because
   a key generated on the way in must match a key generated on the way
   out, exactly, forever.

   The rules about WHAT may be edited come from src/lib/editable.ts —
   the same module the API routes import, so the browser never offers an
   edit the server is going to refuse.

   Shape of the thing:

     · every leaf that holds one run of words becomes editable, and a
       run that shares its parent with a <br>, an icon or a <strong> is
       given a leaf of its own so that it can be one too
     · nothing is locked by what it says — the figure denylist was
       removed on 13 Aug 2026 at the owner's request. The only copy the
       editor still leaves alone is what an author opted out by hand
       with data-no-edit.
     · none of this exists for a visitor. BaseLayout only imports this
       file when the `nt_edit_ui` hint cookie is set, and the check is
       repeated at the top of this file for the case the import happens
       anyway — a cached bundle, a hand-typed import. It is a hint, not
       authorisation: the token cookie the write routes check is what
       actually decides anything (src/lib/edit-auth.ts).
     · none of it is live until "Edit text" is pressed; with the mode on,
       one click enters an element and no link navigates
     · one element is editable at a time, and only while it has focus
     · saving is optimistic: the text changes, then the POST goes; a
       rejection puts the old text back and says why
     · nothing is ever destroyed — a revert writes a new row

   No framework, no build-time dependency beyond the shared rules.

/* ============================================================
   Gestures
   ------------------------------------------------------------
   Everything here is off until someone presses "Edit text".

   That switch is the whole design. Before it existed, the editor had to
   infer intent from the gesture alone, and the only gestures available
   were the two the browser had already spoken for: double-click, which
   is how you select a word, and long-press, which is how you select
   text on a phone. So a reader could fall into editing, and — worse —
   copy inside a link could not reliably be reached at all. The first
   click of a double-click follows the href before the second one
   arrives, and holding an anchor starts the browser's own link drag,
   which cancels the hold. Every CTA on this site is an anchor.

   With an explicit mode, intent is stated once and the gestures stop
   competing:

     off   nothing is bound. Reading is reading; links are links.
     on    one click enters an element. A capture-phase handler calls
           preventDefault on every click first, so an anchor stays put
           instead of navigating.
     both  a right-click (desktop) or a ~500 ms hold (touch) on an
           element that has been edited opens its version list.

   The click rule is narrower than "swallow everything", and the
   difference matters. A click is only intercepted when it lands on
   something editable; anything else is left completely alone. So while
   the mode is on you can still work the page — open the mobile menu,
   drive a carousel, open a lightbox — and reach the copy you actually
   want to change, while the copy itself stops behaving like a control.

   That distinction is what makes the site's own click handlers safe.
   Several of them would otherwise fight the editor:

     · every .mobile-link closes the mobile menu (SiteHeader), so
       clicking a nav link to edit it would shut the panel first
     · "View all N photos" opens the lightbox (gallery.astro)
     · the project rails and dots move the carousel

   All three hang off text that is itself editable, and all three are
   suppressed by stopPropagation here — while the menu toggle, the
   gallery tiles and the arrows, none of which are editable, keep
   working normally.
